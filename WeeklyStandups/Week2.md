# Week 2 Standup 

## What I have done in the past week:
This past week, I narrowed down the specific metrics I want to track for my productivity. I realized the most meaningful 
ones for me are study hours, sleep hours, and screen time, since these directly affect how focused and energized I feel.

## What challenges I have encountered in the past week:
The challenge was that there were so many possible habits I could track—like exercise, diet, or mood—and it started to feel overwhelming. I was also worried that if I tried to track too many things, I wouldn’t be able to keep up with it consistently.

## How I overcame these challenges during the week:
To manage this, I simplified the scope and chose just three core metrics. They’re easy to measure in hours and will still 
give me useful insights without being too complicated.

## What I will do in the next week:
Next week, I’ll start daily logging using a simple spreadsheet. To stay consistent, I’ll set a reminder on my phone to enter the data each night. My goal is just to build the habit of recording data regularly.
