**14-Week Standup Plan: Personal Productivity Data Project**




*Project Overview*

This repository documents my 14-week journey to improve personal productivity through data tracking and analysis.

Each week, I record a short standup update with:
-- What have you done in the past week?
-- Challenges/blockers encountered in the past week?
-- What will you do in the next week?

By the end of the project, I aim to identify patterns in my study, sleep, screen time, and related habits — and test how small changes affect overall productivity.




*Repository Structure*

The repository is organized by week:
/Week1
/Week2
/Week3
...
/Week14

Each file contains the weekly progress report.




*Productivity Metrics Tracked*

Throughout the project, I focused on:
-- Study Time (hours/day)
-- Sleep Duration (hours/night)
-- Screen Time (hours/day)
-- Exercise Time (optional, limited weeks)
-- Daily Productivity Rating (1–5 scale)




*Goals*
-- Build consistent habit tracking.
-- Visualize trends across weeks.
-- Experiment with small changes (e.g., reducing screen time before bed).
-- Reflect on insights for long-term productivity improvement.




*Future Work*
This project ends at Week 14, but I plan to continue tracking and refining habits beyond this course for ongoing self-improvement.
