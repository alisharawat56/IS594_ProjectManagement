###Week 1: Kickoff — Framing the Project

##What have you done in the past week?
--> This past week, I chose my project topic, which is analyzing my own personal productivity using data. 
I thought this would be a meaningful area because it’s something I want to improve personally and it also ties 
well into project management concepts.

##Challenges/blockers encountered in the past week?
--> I wouldn’t say I faced technical challenges yet, but more questions about how to shape the project. Productivity 
is such a broad and subjective concept, which made it hard to figure out how to measure clearly. To address these, 
I first defined what productivity means for me personally: it’s about balancing habits and everyday activities in a way 
that helps me stay focused and reach my academic and personal goals.

##What will you do in the next week?
--> For next week, my goal is to finalize which metrics I’ll begin tracking first, and then figure out the best way to record 
the data every day—whether that’s in a spreadsheet, through an app, or even manually at first.
